## Projects

[Chore Tyrant](https://shelby-norris.github.io/chore-tyrant/) is my first project as a web development student! It uses a pretty simple JavaScript event to display random household chores for you to complete when you're feeling a bit unmotivated and indecisive. I had so much fun making it and hope to add more functionality in the future. Be sure to check out the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/shelby-norris/chore-tyrant)!
